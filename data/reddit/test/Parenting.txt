2 year old stuttering two phrases.
Been married 4 years and considering divorce. Need advice about our kid.
[31/F] My boyfriend [32/M] and I of nine years are breaking up. We have 2 kids [5 and 2], but we can't afford to move out. Can we still live together but separated? Please, someone help.
Advice please? Parents of emo/goth kids or adults who were emo/goth as teens.
